**The second cover on this brilliant piece of kit that is my new TD-27. Now with new and improved studio panels in the back as well. Production quality through the fuckin roof.**

I won't say much about the cover itself. Basically the first actual usable take. Overall pretty happy with it, especially with the showmanship — you can see I love drumming. For me, it's the most important part of any cover (and of drumming). I focused too much on perfecting the cover itself in the past; to the point that I was so frustrated I'd hate covering songs altogether.

I hope that'll change now.

With this new drumset I have implemented a little practice routine, which I hope will make my overall drumming a bit better.

At the time of writing I'm still thinking about keeping the previous version of this website — with all its content, both covers and articles — up so you can see the difference. Not sure though.
