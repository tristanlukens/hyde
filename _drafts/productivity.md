**I'm hopelessly addicted to my phone. Tried a lot of stuff to minimise my screen time over the last few years, but none of them have really sticked.**

**I still use ScreenZen (which you really should use too!) — as my therapist more or less made me — but it's not enough.**

## Chapter I — YouTube

Years ago, when I was a wee lad, I just liked to watch YouTube videos on my iPad mini. Life was a lot simpler back then. At one point, during a school break in May, I realised I'd waste lots of time if I kept this habit.

So... I deleted YouTube from my iPad. From what I remember, I had a pretty good two weeks. I can't remember what I did, but I'm sure it was less wasteful than only watching videos all day.

Don't get me wrong — there isn't anything wrong with winding down with a cup of joe and a well-crafted YouTube video, made by a team of passionate people. Hell, that's usually the way I like to relax just before bed. From watching furniture making videos by Foureyes, or Alec Steele making titanium damascus blades, to relaxing Minecraft videos by ItsMarloe or exploring the insanity of WWII aircraft with Real Engineering.

The occasional Office compilation, or Matt Rose video can be fantastic as well.

What I'm getting at, is this — watching YouTube videos isn't inherently bad. Of course it isn't. But the way I used to do, could be seen as "too much". I'd keep putting off _doing fun things_. Then, when the break would be over, I feel I'd had failed.

This still happens sometimes. But the real problem lies with short-form content.

## Chapter II — Short-form content

TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts. Short-form content. It sucks. It sucks you in and doesn't let you go. But short-form content isn't the only problem.

All apps nowadays fry your brain chemical circuits, for profit.

Using human psychology — and its weaknesses — for profit isn't new. And the most hilarious part: early programmers knew this. They even struggled with it themselves.

But in my experience, the rise of short-form content made everything so much worse.

## Chapter III — Arthur Morgan

This might seem disconnected from the story, but hold your horses. (See what I did there?)

In December 2018, my family got a PS4. Then in March of 2019, I started playing Read Dead Redemption 2. Captivated by the gorgeous style and graphics, depth of the story, and extensive world building, I fell in love with the game pretty quickly.

But for me, what to this day stands out the most, is Arthur's journal.

Even though I think it's the best game ever, I couldn't bring myself to finish the story — it ended up taking 6 years in total.

For years, I wanted to journal like Arthur did. Never really got around to it, till summer 2023.
