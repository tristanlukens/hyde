_On the 9th of May this year, Sleep Token — one of my favourite bands — dropped their highly anticipated fourth album titled "Even In Arcadia". And good lord, it's amazing._

The morning of that day I called the record store I usually go to, and asked them if I could order the CD and get it the same day. If yes, I would stay off social media and avoid hearing anything off the album, so when I'd get home, I could hear it the first time on good speakers and in one go.

And you already know that the answer's yes.

I meandered over to the store, bought the CD (along side like 16 other second hand CDs) and headed home.

After I had made a cup of tea it was fucking go time.

I inserted the disc into my player, turned on my amplifier, and pressed play. My journal was right in front of me for taking notes. I ended up writing a couple of things down, but I was locked in to the music for the most part.

Let me tell you, I was blown away. Masterpiece of an album. Absolutely highly recommend.
